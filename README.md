# Implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

This is the final report of Advanced Statistical Machine Learning course presented
by authors. The report summarizes the generative adversarial networks (GANs).
The report describes: (1) What problem could GAN solve, (2) What are the concept
and cost function of GAN, (3) Architecture of our GAN with hidden layers, and
implementation on MNIST, SVHN and CelebA data, (4) Result of our GAN
model, (5) Implementations using WGAN Model on MNIST and SVHN data, (6)
Discussion of important takeaways and potential improvements.
